This time, I worked on a small project with the **ESP32-CAM**, focusing on capturing an image and displaying it on an **OLED screen** that only supports two colors. The challenge here was to process grayscale image data and convert it into a binary format suitable for the OLED display.  

### üîπ Workflow:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ The ESP32-CAM captures an image using its camera module.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ A web server running on the ESP32 allows image retrieval via a browser.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The captured grayscale image is downscaled and converted into a black-and-white format for OLED display.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Pressing a button triggers image capture and display on the OLED.  

The main goal of this project was to experiment with **image processing, embedded development, and I2C communication**‚Äîa great learning experience!
